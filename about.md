<p>I have been very passionate about technology from a young age. 
	My father worked at Bell Labs in the late 80s and early 90s and brought home my very first computer, an Intel Pentium II powered machine. 
	I was immediately fascinated by how the DOS command interpreter worked, and the rest, as they say, is history.
</p>
<p>
	My introduction to programming came about during video game modding, which allowed one to modify the game world that one was playing in. 
	This further cemented my passion for technology, particularly virtual machines embedded in game engines at the time, such as the Quake Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>Over the span of my now nine year career, I have worked in various technical roles at big name companies such as Apple and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 
	However, I've found that working for startups greatly ramps up ones learning capabilities and speed. 
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am consulting for a video games startup called <a href="https://merigo.co">Merigo</a>. I have vast amounts of experience in not only developing products across fullstack (i.e. backend and frontend) but also deploying, maintaining, and monitoring such products. Please feel free to email me, and my consulting company, Moonshot Consulting LLC, can turn your wildest dreams into a technical reality within reasonable budget constraints. Looking forward to working with you!
